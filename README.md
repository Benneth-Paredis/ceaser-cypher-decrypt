# ceaser-cypher-decrypt
Little project I made in an hour to learn a little about cryptography.
Takes whole string which may be very slow when the string is long so an optional solution for in the future is to only look at the first n words.
Still needs to be optimized alot.

TO DO:
Detect which shift amount is correct by detecting real words and then returning the shift value.
add encrypt file to encrypt message via ceaser cipher.
